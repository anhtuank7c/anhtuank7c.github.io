  summary: |
    I'm a 34 years old Software Engineer passionated about programming. I've worked with React Native framework for years, and I can do both backend and frontend websites that uses ReactJS. I don't hesitate to dig into a problem, analyze it, and resolve it with a clear refinement. No one is perfect, but I listen to others in order to improve. I am full of positive energy to learn new things and improve my skills day by day. I have done remote work since 2018, and have no problem with distractions by using the Pomodoro Technique to manage focus and break time. I personally want to dig more into SwiftUI and kick off the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 days of SwiftUI challenge</a>, I'm optimistic that I can manage it well. I have a <a href="https://anhtuank7c.github.io/assets/docs/RecommendationforNguyenAnhTuanG.Shisler.docx" download>recommendation letter from Equilab right here</a> in case you're interested

experiences:
  - role: Software Engineer
    time: Oct 2018 - Mar 2023
    company: Equestrian Insights AB (dba Equilab)
    link: https://equilab.horse
    details: |
      Joined Equilab as a React Native lead, I helped the team to develop new features such as Social Feed, Friend suggestions, Premium Calendar, Training Histories, Training summaries, Training Weather (premium), High-level graph of gaits analysis, and countless improvement.<br/>
      I've learned so much from teammates, clean code, reduce the complexity of each commit/merge request, and also critical thinking.
      We debate a lot on how to improve the product and also the solution to resolve the problem.<br/>
      My English communication is still in the developing stage but the whole team never let me be behind, together we achieved some milestones such as reaching <strong>500k</strong> users in June 2020 and <strong>1M</strong> users in 2021.<br/>
      We develop things in JS at first but it become a bit messy once features become bigger, I am the one who responds in TypeScript transition, and I could say it helped us a lot with all the benefits of TypeScript such as static type-checking, shaping data, reduce the number of runtime errors.<br />
      The transition process is a bit challenge since we need to balance the resource between develop new feature, fix bugs and transition existing JS to TS. I research a bit and found 2 solution, transition vertically by converting feature by feature and transition horizontally by convert all the files extension from <code>.js</code> to <code>.ts</code><br/>
      Finally I choosed horizontal transition, by that way I can apply to the whole project, develop new feature in TypeScript immediately, reduce the plenty of issues in the new feature. For all the old code, we spent 10% of resource each years (sometime more) to convert it. This process will take years to complete but it give us a balance.<br/>
      Besides TypeScript, I also use Swift and Kotlin to write a native bridge to communicate between native and JS, and some native functionality such as dev feature flag system, and native UI but not that much.
