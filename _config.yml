  I've worked with React Native framework since later 2016 up to now, and I do both backend and frontend websites that uses ReactJS/SvelteKit, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Elysia, NodeJS, Redis.
  I also write native module for React Native to communicate with native side using Swift and Kotlin. I already publish some open source projects.
  I don't hesitate to dig into a problem, analyze it, and resolve it with a clear refinement. No one is perfect, so am I, but I never stop learning, research and improve myself day by day.
