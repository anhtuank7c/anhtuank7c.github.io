  I'm a 34 years old Software Engineer passionated about programming.
  I've worked with React Native framework for years, and I can do both backend and frontend websites that uses ReactJS/SvelteKit.
  I don't hesitate to dig into a problem, analyze it, and resolve it with a clear refinement. No one is perfect, but I listen to others in order to improve.
  I am full of positive energy to learn new things and improve my skills day by day.
  I have done remote work since 2018, and have no problem with distractions by using the Pomodoro Technique to manage focus and break time.
  I am digging into SvelteKit recently.
